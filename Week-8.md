S3: is a Simple Storage Service

It is a cloud-based object storage service used to store files like:
Documents,Images,Videos,Backups,Logs,Static website files (like HTML, CSS, JS)

 Key Features of S3:
Object-based storage: Stores data as objects (not files or blocks), each containing data, metadata, and a unique key.
Unlimited storage: You can store as much data as you want.
High durability: Designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability.
Scalability: Automatically scales to handle growing amounts of data and traffic.
Security: Supports encryption, IAM, bucket policies, and ACLs.
Versioning: Tracks changes to objects, allowing recovery of deleted or modified files.
Static website hosting: Can serve HTML/CSS/JS files directly via HTTP.
Lifecycle policies: Automate transitions between storage classes or deletion of old data.

How S3 Works (Basics):
S3 bucket: container to hold files
Object: set of files stored in a bucket is called object
Key: every file is named as key in the bucket
Region:Buckets are created in a specific AWS region

| Task            | Command                                    
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Create a bucket |   aws s3 mb s3://bucket name          |
| Upload file     |  aws s3 cp file.txt s3://bucket name/ |
| Download file   |  aws s3 cp s3://bucketname/file.txt |
| List contents   |   aws s3 ls s3://bucketname  

Storage tiers:

| Storage Class               | Use Case                              | Key Feature                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **S3 Standard**             | Frequently accessed files             | Fast access, high availability      |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**  | Data with changing access patterns    | Auto-moves data to cheaper tier     |
| **S3 Standard-IA**          | Infrequently accessed files           | Lower cost, but small retrieval fee |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**          | Infrequent access, not critical files | Stored in a single AZ, cheaper      |
| **S3 Glacier**              | Archive storage (long-term backups)   | Cheap, 1-5 min retrieval            |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** | Rarely accessed (e.g. yearly backups) | Lowest cost, 12+ hours to restore   |

AWS PRICING:

Storage Cost â€“ Charged per GB per month based on the storage class (e.g., Standard, Glacier).
Request Cost â€“ Charges apply for each operation like PUT, GET, DELETE, etc.
Data Transfer â€“ Outbound data transfer from S3 to the internet incurs charges.
Lifecycle Transitions â€“ Costs apply when objects move between storage tiers (e.g., to Glacier).
Replication â€“ Additional charges for cross-region or same-region replication of data.
Management Tools â€“ Features like S3 Inventory, analytics, and Object Lock incur extra costs.
Early Deletion Fees â€“ Some storage classes (like Glacier) charge if objects are deleted early.

Bucket Policy:
Bucket Policy is a JSON-based access control mechanism that defines who can access your S3 bucket and what actions they can perform.

ðŸ”¹ Common Use Cases with Examples:
Allow Public Read Access â€“ For static website hosting:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
}

Allow Only a Specific IAM User:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/MyUser" },
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name", "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"]
}

Restrict Access by IP Address:

 {
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*",
  "Condition": {
    "NotIpAddress": {
      "aws:SourceIp": "192.0.2.0/24"
    }
  }
}


Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to automate the creation and management of S3 buckets and their configurations in AWS.

ðŸ”¹ Common Terraform Examples for S3:
âœ… Create a Private S3 Bucket:

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"
}

ðŸ”„ Enable Versioning:

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

 Add Lifecycle Rules:

 resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "lifecycle" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  rule {
    id     = "archive-old-data"
    status = "Enabled"

    transition {
      days          = 30
      storage_class = "GLACIER"
    }
  }
}

Apply a Bucket Policy:


resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "policy" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [{
      Effect = "Allow",
      Principal = "*",
      Action = "s3:GetObject",
      Resource = "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}/*"
    }]
  })
}

Step-by-Step Guide
ðŸ”¸ Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket with Your Domain Name
Go to S3 Console

Click Create bucket

Bucket name = www.yourdomain.com (must match your domain exactly)

Uncheck Block all public access

Click Create bucket

ðŸ”¸ Step 2: Enable Static Website Hosting
Go to the bucket â†’ Properties

Scroll down to Static website hosting

Enable it:

Hosting type: Host a static website

Index document: index.html

Error document: error.html (optional)

Click Save changes

ðŸ”¸ Step 3: Upload Your Website Files
Go to Objects tab in the bucket

Click Upload â†’ Select index.html (and others if any)

Click Upload

ðŸ”¸ Step 4: Make Your Files Public
Go to Permissions â†’ Bucket Policy

Add this policy (replace your bucket name):

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::www.yourdomain.com/*"
    }
  ]
}
Step 5: Set Up DNS in Route 53
Go to Route 53 â†’ Hosted Zones

Click on your domain (e.g., yourdomain.com)

Click Create Record

Choose Record type: A â€“ IPv4 address

Select Alias: Yes

Choose Alias target â†’ From the dropdown, pick your S3 website endpoint (e.g., s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com)

Name: www or root (@) depending on setup

Click Create records

ðŸ”¸ Step 6: Test Your Website
Wait for DNS to propagate (usually 1â€“5 minutes)

Open http://www.yourdomain.com

cd /
nano main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Change this to your desired region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "vinitha98-example-bucket"  # MUST be globally unique
  acl    = "private"
}

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

Obtain an SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager.

Attach the certificate to your CloudFront distribution for HTTPS support.

IAM Basics
a. IAM User
Represents a person or application with long-term credentials (username/password or access keys).

b. IAM Roles
Define a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. Used by services or users temporarily assuming roles.

c. IAM Policies
JSON documents that define permissions. Attach to users, groups, or roles to grant or restrict access.

d. Groups
A collection of IAM users. Apply the same set of permissions to multiple users.

e. Access Keys & Secret Keys
Programmatic credentials used for CLI, SDK, and API access.
