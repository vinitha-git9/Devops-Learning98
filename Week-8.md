What is S3:

is a Simple Storage Service
It is a cloud-based object storage service used to store files like:
Documents,Images,Videos,Backups,Logs,Static website files (like HTML, CSS, JS)

How S3 Works (Basics):
S3 bucket: container to hold files
Object: set of files stored in a bucket is called object
Key: every file is named as key in the bucket
Region:Buckets are created in a specific AWS region

| Task            | Command                                    
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Create a bucket |   aws s3 mb s3://bucket name          |
| Upload file     |  aws s3 cp file.txt s3://bucket name/ |
| Download file   |  aws s3 cp s3://bucketname/file.txt |
| List contents   |   aws s3 ls s3://bucketname  


Key Features of S3:
Object-based storage: Stores data as objects (not files or blocks), each containing data, metadata, and a unique key.
Unlimited storage: You can store as much data as you want.
High durability: Designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability.
Scalability: Automatically scales to handle growing amounts of data and traffic.
Security: Supports encryption, IAM, bucket policies, and ACLs.
Versioning: Tracks changes to objects, allowing recovery of deleted or modified files.
Static website hosting: Can serve HTML/CSS/JS files directly via HTTP.
Lifecycle policies: Automate transitions between storage classes or deletion of old data.

Storage tiers:

| Storage Class               | Use Case                              | Key Feature                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **S3 Standard**             | Frequently accessed files             | Fast access, high availability      |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**  | Data with changing access patterns    | Auto-moves data to cheaper tier     |
| **S3 Standard-IA**          | Infrequently accessed files           | Lower cost, but small retrieval fee |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**          | Infrequent access, not critical files | Stored in a single AZ, cheaper      |
| **S3 Glacier**              | Archive storage (long-term backups)   | Cheap, 1-5 min retrieval            |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** | Rarely accessed (e.g. yearly backups) | Lowest cost, 12+ hours to restore   |

Security:
| Security Layer        | Purpose                                    | Recommended  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| IAM Policies          | Control user/role access                   | ‚úÖ            |
| Bucket Policies       | Control access to buckets                  | ‚úÖ            |
| ACLs                  | Object-level control (legacy)              | ‚ùå Avoid      |
| Block Public Access   | Prevent accidental public exposure         | ‚úÖ            |
| Encryption at Rest    | Protect stored data                        | ‚úÖ            |
| Encryption in Transit | Protect data on the move                   | ‚úÖ            |
| S3 Access Logging     | Monitor access                             | ‚úÖ            |

| Versioning            | Recover from accidental overwrites/deletes | ‚úÖ            |

AWS PRICING:

Storage Cost ‚Äì Charged per GB per month based on the storage class (e.g., Standard, Glacier).
Request Cost ‚Äì Charges apply for each operation like PUT, GET, DELETE, etc.
Data Transfer ‚Äì Outbound data transfer from S3 to the internet incurs charges.
Lifecycle Transitions ‚Äì Costs apply when objects move between storage tiers (e.g., to Glacier).
Replication ‚Äì Additional charges for cross-region or same-region replication of data.
Management Tools ‚Äì Features like S3 Inventory, analytics, and Object Lock incur extra costs.
Early Deletion Fees ‚Äì Some storage classes (like Glacier) charge if objects are deleted early.

Bucket Policy:
Bucket Policy is a JSON-based access control mechanism that defines who can access your S3 bucket and what actions they can perform.

üîπ Common Use Cases with Examples:
Allow Public Read Access ‚Äì For static website hosting:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
}

Allow Only a Specific IAM User:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/MyUser" },
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name", "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"]
}

Restrict Access by IP Address:

 {
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*",
  "Condition": {
    "NotIpAddress": {
      "aws:SourceIp": "192.0.2.0/24"
    }
  }
}

Terraform for S3:

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to automate the creation and management of S3 buckets and their configurations in AWS.

üîπ Common Terraform Examples for S3:
‚úÖ Create a Private S3 Bucket:

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"
}

üîÑ Enable Versioning:

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

 Add Lifecycle Rules:

 resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "lifecycle" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  rule {
    id     = "archive-old-data"
    status = "Enabled"

    transition {
      days          = 30
      storage_class = "GLACIER"
    }
  }
}

Apply a Bucket Policy:


resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "policy" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [{
      Effect = "Allow",
      Principal = "*",
      Action = "s3:GetObject",
      Resource = "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}/*"
    }]
  })
}

Cloud front:

Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service from AWS that securely delivers data, videos, applications, 
and APIs to users globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.

When a user makes a request for your content, CloudFront delivers it from the nearest edge location, reducing latency and improving load times. This ensures low-latency delivery, high transfer speeds, and an optimized user experience.

it easily integrates with other AWS services like Amazon S3, EC2, Lambda@Edge, and API Gateway.

How cloud front works:
 Step 1: User Requests Content
 Step 2: DNS Routes the Request
 Step 3: CloudFront Checks for Cached Content

If it‚Äôs stored: CloudFront gives the content right away.
If not stored: CloudFront sends the request to the main server to get the content.
Step 4: Content Comes from the Origin Server
Step 5: CloudFront Caches the Content
Step 6: CloudFront Delivers Content
Step 7: Future Requests
Step 8: Cache Update (When Needed)

Key Features of AWS CloudFront:

1. Faster Content Delivery Across the Globe
2. Works Seamlessly with AWS Services
3. Built-in Security & Protection Against Attacks
4. Efficient Caching for Both Static & Dynamic Content
5. Budget-Friendly & Scales with Your Needs
6. Customizable with Lambda@Edge

An S3 bucket (with static website hosting enabled)
A public ACM certificate (in us-east-1c region for CloudFront)
A custom domain (optional)
Terraform installed locally

Create static s3 site with HTTPS:

S3 bucket with static website hosting
ACM SSL certificate (in us-east-1, required for CloudFront)
CloudFront distribution with HTTPS
Route 53 record pointing to your domain (optional)

IAM Basics:
IAM is a service by AWS that lets you securely control access to AWS services and resources.

It allows you to manage:
Who can access your AWS resources
What actions they can perform
Which resources they can access

| Component       | Description                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **User**        | An individual identity with credentials to access AWS (e.g., admin, developer)                   |
| **Group**       | A collection of IAM users; you can assign **policies** to a group                                |
| **Policy**      | A JSON document that defines permissions (Allow/Deny)                                            |
| **Role**        | An IAM identity **you can assume temporarily** ‚Äî often used by services (e.g., EC2 to access S3) |
| **Access Key**  | Used by IAM users to access AWS programmatically (CLI, SDK)                                      |
| **Permissions** | Defined using policies that determine what a user or role can do                                 |


What Are Access Keys and Secret Keys?
They are credentials used by IAM users to make programmatic requests to AWS (via:
AWS CLI
SDKs (like Python Boto3, Node.js, etc.)

Terraform:

Key	Description
Access Key ID	Public identifier (like a username)
Secret Access Key	Private key (like a password)

‚ùó Keep the Secret Key secure ‚Äî it‚Äôs only shown once when you create it!
