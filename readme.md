Kernel:

The "father of the kernel," specifically referring to the Linux kernel, is Linus Torvalds

1.	essentially the core of an operating system.
2.	 It is the fundamental layer that exists between the computer hardware and the software.
interactIng with hardware, and it is often considered the nucleus of a computer’s operating system.
3.	It manages the system resources, including the processor, memvory, and device drivers
4.	kernel is stored in the computer’s memory
Types of Kernel:
Monolithic kernels:
1.	means the entire operating system, including schedulers, file system, and device drivers, is included in the kernel, making it large and complex.
2.	It can also result in system instability if a single service fails.
Microkernels:
1.	operate by running the minimal amount of services needed for the operating system to function in kernel space
2.	can improve reliability and security,
Hybrid kernel:
1.	attempt to combine the best elements of both monolithic and microkernel designs. 
2.	They aim to achieve the efficiency of monolithic kernels by running some services in kernel space while maintaining the reliability and security of microkernels by running other services in user space
