# üåê Terraform: Infrastructure as Code

Terraform is an open-source **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool developed by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/).  
It allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)** or JSON.

Terraform supports managing infrastructure on **AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes**, and many other platforms.

---

## ‚ùì Why is Terraform Required?

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
  Write and manage infrastructure using code ‚Äî repeatable, version-controlled, and automated.

- **Consistency Across Environments**  
  Use the same codebase for dev, staging, and production environments.

- **Multi-Cloud Support**  
  Supports multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, etc.) from a single tool.

- **Dependency Management**  
  Automatically handles resource dependencies and builds in the correct order.

- **Version Control**  
  Configuration files are plain text and can be stored in Git for team collaboration and history tracking.

- **Plan and Review Before Applying**  
  Use `terraform plan` to preview changes before execution.

- **Automation and Integration**  
  Easily integrates into CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

What is SSH?
SSH stands for Secure Shell.

It is a secure way to connect to another computer remotely
You need a private key file (like MyKeyPair.pem) to prove it‚Äôs you.

ssh -i MyKeyPair.pem ec2-user@54.123.45.67

A Security Group is like a firewall for your EC2 instance.

| Type  | Protocol | Port | Source                         |
| ----- | -------- | ---- | ------------------------------ |
| SSH   | TCP      | 22   | 0.0.0.0/0 (anyone, not secure) |
| HTTP  | TCP      | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0                      |
| HTTPS | TCP      | 443  | 0.0.0.0/0                      |


## üñ•Ô∏è Install Terraform on Linux

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add HashiCorp GPG key
wget -O - https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg

# Add the Terraform repository
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] \
https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(grep -oP '(?<=UBUNTU_CODENAME=).*' /etc/os-release || lsb_release -cs) main" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list

# Update and install Terraform
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform -y


A simple Configure Terraform (Basic Setup):

mkdir ~/terraformdemo
cd ~/main.tf
nano main.tf

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
}

provider "local" {}

resource "local_file" "example" {
  content  = "Hello, Terraform!"
  filename = "${path.module}/hello.txt"
}

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

Terraform will create a file named hello.txt with the content:

Hello, Terraform!

To remove the created resources:
 terraform detroy

üöÄ Suggested Command Workflow

terraform init        # Initialize the project
terraform validate    # Check for syntax errors
terraform fmt         # Format your code
terraform plan        # Preview the changes
terraform apply       # Apply changes
terraform destroy     # (Optional) Tear everything down

Learn about state file and why it is required:

State file: A state file is a crucial component that keeps track of the infrastructure resources that the tool manages.
Typically named: terraform.tfstate

It contains a JSON-formatted record of:

All resources that have been created
Resource metadata (IDs, attributes, dependencies, etc.)
The current state and configuration
Resource mappings to your code.

Why it is required:

Mapping real infrastructure to code
Detecting Drift
Performance
Tracking changes
supports collaboration

Consideration:
Sensitive data, locking, corruption/loss

üîÑ Common Commands Involving State in Terraform

terraform state list
terraform state show (resource)
terraform refresh

| Concept         | Description                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What it is      | JSON file tracking current state of managed infrastructure    |
| Why it's needed | Maps code to real resources, enables safe & efficient updates |
| Risks           | Sensitive, must be secured and managed carefully              |
| Best practice   | Use remote storage with locking for team use                  |

What is a Backend in Terraform?

A backend in Terraform determines:
where the state file is stored
how state operation like reading, locking and writing are performed
who can access and update the state file

commonly named backend.tf

Write terraform scripts to execute basic linux commands, to create and zip a file:

Step:1  How can I use Terraform to run Linux commands like "create a file" and "zip it"?

So, to run Linux commands, we need to:
Use Terraform to create a virtual machine (like an EC2 instance in AWS).
SSH into that machine automatically.
Run the Linux commands using a "provisioner."

Basic Flow
Terraform creates a Linux server (like an EC2 in AWS).
Terraform connects to that server using SSH.
It runs your Linux commands: create file ‚Üí zip file.

üß© What You Need
To make it work, you‚Äôll need:

An AWS account
A key pair (SSH key)
Terraform installed

Let‚Äôs first do it on your own machine using local-exec.

cd /
mkdir terraform
cd terraform
nano main.tf

resource "null_resource" "file_example" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<EOT
      echo "Hello from Terraform" > myfile.txt
      zip myfile.zip myfile.txt
    EOT
  }
}

What this does:
Creates a file called myfile.txt with some text
Compresses (zips) that file into myfile.zip
All on your own computer, not in the cloud

terraform init
terraform apply
 You‚Äôll see the files myfile.txt and myfile.zip in your folder.

 step:3 running Linux commands on a remote VM (like an AWS EC2 instance) using Terraform.

create a directory: mkdir demotera
cd demotera
nano ec2.tf

make sure you have:
AWS account, aws key pair, access key, 

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"      # Change to your preferred region
}

resource "aws_key_pair" "deployer" {
  key_name   = "my-key"     # Replace with your key name
  public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")  # Path to your public SSH key
}

resource "aws_security_group" "ssh_access" {
  name        = "allow_ssh"
  description = "Allow SSH inbound traffic"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]   # Allow SSH from anywhere (for testing only)
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "linux_vm" {
  ami                    = "ami-0c02fb55956c7d316"  # Amazon Linux 2 AMI in us-east-1; change for your region
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  key_name               = aws_key_pair.deployer.key_name
  security_groups        = [aws_security_group.ssh_access.name]

  tags = {
    Name = "TerraformExampleInstance"
  }
}

output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.linux_vm.public_ip
}


terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

Apply complete!
Outputs:
instance_public_ip = "3.91.123.45"

SSH into your EC2 instance using the command:

2. Set correct permissions on the key
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ec2-user@3.91.123.45

now connected to AWS EC2 user.

Point to remember:
Terraform installed
AWS installed and configured
terraform components:

üîπ provider block
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

üîπ resource block for EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "linux_vm" {
  ami           = "ami-0c02fb55956c7d316"  # Example for Amazon Linux 2 in us-east-1
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "my-key-pair"            # Must match an existing EC2 key pair

  tags = {
    Name = "MyLinuxVM"
  }
}

üîπ resource block for key pair:

resource "aws_key_pair" "deployer" {
  key_name   = "my-key-pair"
  public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")  # Make sure this path and file exist
}

üîπ resource block for security group (for SSH access)

resource "aws_security_group" "ssh" {
  name        = "allow_ssh"
  description = "Allow SSH inbound traffic"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Allow from anywhere (not safe for production)
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

Attach this security group to the instance:

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.ssh.id]

output block:
output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.linux_vm.public_ip
}

‚úÖ 3. Commands to Use

What is cloud computing:

The cloud computing is the delivery of computing services like servers, database, storage, networking and software over the internet.
Instead of owing the physical server, you can rent computer powers and services from the cloud provider.

Common Cloud Providers
AWS ‚Äì Amazon Web Services
Azure ‚Äì Microsoft‚Äôs cloud platform
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

üîë Cloud Computing Models

IaaS: Infrasturture as a Service(Example: AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines)
PaaS: Platform as a Service( you manage app,Easier for developers to deploy code. Eg:AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku
SaaS: Software as a Service( Fully managed software delivered via the web eg: Gmail, Dropbox, Office 365) 

üèóÔ∏è Cloud Service Categories:

| Category       | Example AWS Service       | What It Does                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Compute**    | EC2, Lambda               | Run code or apps                |
| **Storage**    | S3, EBS, Glacier          | Store files or backups          |
| **Databases**  | RDS, DynamoDB             | Manage structured data          |
| **Networking** | VPC, Route 53, CloudFront | Manage traffic and security     |

üìà Benefits of Cloud Computing:

Scalability ‚Äì Automatically grow/shrink resources
Cost Efficiency ‚Äì Pay-as-you-go
High Availability ‚Äì Services across multiple regions
Security ‚Äì Built-in controls and compliance

 IAM in the Cloud (Identity and Access Management)

IAM lets you:
Create User.
Define what resources they can access
securely manage permission

üõ†Ô∏è Real-Life Example

Want to run the website,

Launch a virtual server (EC2)
Store images/files (S3)
Use a database (RDS)
Restrict access using IAM

Types of deployment model:

1.Deployment model:

Public cloud:Owned and operated by third-party cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP.
Example: Hosting a website on AWS EC2.

Private cloud: Cloud infrastructure is used exclusively by one organization.
Example: A bank hosting internal applications on its own data center.

Hybrid Cloud:A mix of public and private clouds working together.
Example: An e-commerce app that runs the website on AWS and keeps customer records in a private cloud.

‚úÖ d. Multi-Cloud
Use of multiple public cloud providers.
Example: Using AWS for compute and Azure for backup storage.

üß© 2. Service Models
| Model    | What You Manage               | What Cloud Provider Manages | Example Service               |

how to access the EC2 instance from local machine (windows/Linux) using SSM:

step1: create IAM role -> AmazonSSMMangedinstancecore ->add this permission
step2: Launch instance-> remove SSH-> advanced tools-> instance congifure ->add role rule
step3: open ubuntu-> start the session->aws ssm start-session --target <instance-id>
step4: shell opens-> install nginx and apply simple script
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx

echo '<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h1>Hello from NGINX via SSM!</h1></body></html>' \
  | sudo tee /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

sudo systemctl status nginx

4. Allow HTTP Traffic (Security Group)
Outside of SSM, make sure your EC2's security group allows:

Inbound rule for port 80 (HTTP)

From your IP or 0.0.0.0/0 (for testing)

http://<your-ec2-public-ip>/

what is cloud: is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more‚Äîover the internet ("the cloud").
why cloud: cost effective,accessibility,security, scalabitity, speed and agility

Types of cloud: Deployment and Service model

Deployment model:Public(you can access the cloud publicly),
private(you own one private cloud for an organisation)
hybrid cloud(mix of public and private)

Service model: IAAS(, PaaS, SaaS)
