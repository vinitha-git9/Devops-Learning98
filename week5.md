Networt: is a practice of connecting multiple computer devices communicate with each other to share information, resources, and services.
The computer network can be linked through a medium such as cables , telephone lines, satellite or infrared beam.

Types of network:
LAN:Local Area Network- used in home,office or school.
WAN:Wide area Networ that transfer the data from one area to other area.
WLAN (Wireless LAN)LAN that uses Wi-Fi
VPN (Virtual Private Network): Creates a secure connection over the internet

IP Address (Internet Protocol):Like a home address, but for devices.Every device on a network has one
Router: Directs traffic between your local network and the Internet.
Switch: Connects devices within a network (like PCs, printers).
Modem: Connects your home network to your Internet provider.
DNS (Domain Name System):Translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.
Ports:Virtual doors on a device that control what kind of traffic comes in or out
Example:
Port 80 = HTTP (web),
Port 443 = HTTPS,
Port 22 = SSH

Firewall: A security system that controls incoming and outgoing traffic.

. OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection):The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection) is a theoretical framework with 7 layers.

Hint to remember:

"All People Seem To Need Data Processing"
(Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical)

Troubleshooting by Layer:

Learn how problems at each layer look:

Layer 1: Cable unplugged
Layer 3: Wrong IP address
Layer 4: Port blocked by firewall
Layer 7: Web app not responding

| 1    | You type a URL in your browser           | Application  | Application    |
| 2    | The browser formats your request         | Presentation | Application    |
| 3    | A session is established with the server | Session      | Application    |
| 4    | Data is broken into chunks (TCP packets) | Transport    | Transport      |
| 5    | Destination IP is added                  | Network      | Internet       |
| 6    | MAC address added for local delivery     | Data Link    | Network Access |
| 7    | Data is sent via Wi-Fi/Ethernet          | Physical     | Network Access |
