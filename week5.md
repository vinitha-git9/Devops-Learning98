Networt: is a practice of connecting multiple computer devices communicate with each other to share information, resources, and services.
The computer network can be linked through a medium such as cables , telephone lines, satellite or infrared beam.

Types of network:
LAN:Local Area Network- used in home,office or school.
WAN:Wide area Networ that transfer the data from one area to other area.
WLAN (Wireless LAN)LAN that uses Wi-Fi
VPN (Virtual Private Network): Creates a secure connection over the internet

IP Address (Internet Protocol):Like a home address, but for devices.Every device on a network has one

IP stands for Internet Protocol.
It is a set of rules that govern how data is sent and received over the internet or any network.
Each device on a network is assigned a unique IP address.

Types of IP Addresses:

| Type       | Version | Visibility     | Assigned By       | Example      |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| IPv4       | IPv4    | Public/Private | ISP/Admin         | 192.168.1.1  |
| IPv6       | IPv6    | Public/Private | ISP/Admin         | 2001\:db8::1 |
| Public IP  | Either  | Public         | ISP               | 203.0.113.5  |
| Private IP | Either  | Local only     | Router (DHCP)     | 192.168.0.10 |
| Static IP  | Either  | Either         | Manually set      | Varies       |
| Dynamic IP | Either  | Either         | Automatically set | Varies       |

Router: Directs traffic between your local network and the Internet.
Switch: Connects devices within a network (like PCs, printers).
Modem: Connects your home network to your Internet provider.
DNS (Domain Name System):Translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.
Ports:Virtual doors on a device that control what kind of traffic comes in or out
Example:
Port 80 = HTTP (web),
Port 443 = HTTPS,
Port 22 = SSH

Firewall: A security system that controls incoming and outgoing traffic.

DNS is like the phonebook of the internet.
It translates human-friendly domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.190.78) that computers use to talk to each other.

IP stands for Internet Protocol.
It is a set of rules that govern how data is sent and received over the internet or any network.
Each device on a network is assigned a unique IP address.

How DNS Works (Simplified):

You type www.example.com into your browser.
The DNS resolver checks its cache for the IP. If not found:
It asks a root DNS server, then a TLD server, then the authoritative DNS server for example.com.
The resolver gets the IP address and sends it to your browser.
The browser connects to the server at that IP and loads the website.

HTTP Headers:
Http headers is the set of metadata in the http request or response. 
It defines how the data is tranfered between the client and the server.
Headers give extra information such as content type, authentication details, caching instructions, and more.

Structure of an HTTP Header:
Header-Name: Header-Value

Categories of HTTP Headers:

General Headers:
Response headers:
Request Headers:
security headers:
Entity headers:

How to View HTTP Headers:

Browser Dev Tools: Open Dev Tools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Click a request ‚Üí Headers

curl -I https://example.com

Protocol is a set of rules that define how the data is formatted, transmitted and received over the network.
Without protocol, computer wont understand eachother.
Consider protocol like a agreement , where computer follow to commnunicate reliably.


Categories of Protocol:
