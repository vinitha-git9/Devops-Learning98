Week:2

Shell : user interface that provides access to the services of an operating system
Current shell : Bash (Bourne Again Shell
Shell scripting :writing scripts using a shell's scripting language to automate tasks.
              Loops (for, while) ,Conditional logic (if, case) ,Functions, Stream redirection and pipelines, Process substitution
Getting Started with Shell Scripting: Naming, Permissions, Variables, Builtins.
Naming:  touch hello.sh
Permissions: chmod +x hello.sh
How to open shell script: vi hello.sh
#! /bin/bash 
# sharp
! Bang
#! Shebang
Builtins : Type echo
O/p: echo is a shell builtins
To check which shell is using in OS: Echo $SHELL
How to run the script:  ./ hello.sh
Two types if variables:
Environment Variables
          Command	O/P
Echo $bash	/bin/bash
Echo $bash_version	4.0.2.5
Echo $pwd	Desktop
Echo $home	/home/text

User-defined varaibles:
How to use variables:
Name=‚Äôvinitha‚Äô
Echo ‚Äúmy name is $Name‚Äù
o/p:  my name is vinitha
Read User Input:
 
 
 
Append text to varaiable:
Name ‚Äòvinitha‚Äô
Echo ‚Äúmy name is ${Name}R‚Äù
0r
Word ‚Äòstring‚Äô
Echo ‚Äúthis is ${word}ing‚Äù
Combine two variable:
Echo ‚Äú${name}${word}.‚Äù
Special Variables, Pseudocode, Command Substitution, if Statement, Conditionals.
#display the userid and username of the executing user:
#display if the user is root user or not.
UID-to find user id
id -un (used to find the username of the user)
$(...) runs id -un and replaces it with the result.
 
 
#display the uid:
Echo ‚Äúyour userid is ${UID}‚Äù
Uid is manual in bash
O/p: your userid is 1000
General commands manual
Command: man bash
Id -u
o/p: 1000
id -n
o/p: root
If statement:
Syntax:
If  [[ condition ]]
Then
Command
Fi
if-else Condition

num=10
if [[  ${num}  -gt  5 ]]
then 
echo ‚ÄúNumber is greater than 5‚Äù
else
echo ‚ÄúNumber is lesser than 5‚Äù
fi

üîπ 4. String Comparison:
Operators:
‚Ä¢	== : equal
‚Ä¢	!= : not equal
‚Ä¢	-z : string is empty
‚Ä¢	-n : string is not empty
Common file test operators:
‚Ä¢	-f : regular file exists
‚Ä¢	-d : directory exists
‚Ä¢	-e : file or directory exists
‚Ä¢	-r : readable
‚Ä¢	-w : writable
‚Ä¢	-x : executable
5. File Conditions
Example:
File=‚Äùfile.txt‚Äù
If [[  -f ‚Äúfile.txt‚Äù ]]
Then
Echo ‚Äúfile exist‚Äù
Operators:
-f file exsit
-d directory exist
-e file or directory exist
-r reaaable
-w writable
-x executable
Operator	Description	Example
+	Addition	((a+b))
-	Subtraction	((a - b))
*	Multiplication	((a * b))
/	Division	((a / b))
%	Modulus (remainder)	((a % b))
**	Exponentiation	((a ** 
b))
++	Increment	((a++)) or ((++a))
--	Decrement	((a--)) or ((--a))
		
Comparison Operators (Numbers)
Operator	Meaning	Example
-eq	Equal	[ $a -eq $b ]
-ne	Not equal	[ $a -ne $b ]
-gt	Greater than	[ $a -gt $b ]
-lt	Less than	[ $a -lt $b ]
-ge	Greater or equal	[ $a -ge $b ]
-le	Less or equal	[ $a -le $b ]
3. Comparison Operators (Strings)

Operator	Meaning	Example
= or ==	Equal	[[ "$a" == "$b" ]]
!=	Not equal	[[ "$a" != "$b" ]]
-z	Is empty string	[ -z "$a" ]
-n	Is not empty	[ -n "$a" ]

Logical Operators

Operator	Meaning	Example
&&	Logical AND	[[ $a -gt 0 && $b -gt 0 ]]
`		`
!	Logical NOT	[[ ! $a -eq 0 ]]

üîπ 5. File Test Operators
Operator	Tests if...	Example
-e	File exists	[ -e file.txt ]
-f	Regular file	[ -f file.txt ]
-d	Directory	[ -d dir_name ]
-r	Readable	[ -r file.txt ]
-w	Writable	[ -w file.txt ]
-x	Executable	[ -x script.sh ]
-s	File not empty	[ -s file.txt ]
üîπ 6. Assignment Operators
Operator	Meaning	Example
=	Assign value	a=10
+=	Add and assign	((a += 5))
-=	Subtract and assign	((a -= 5))
*=	Multiply and assign	((a *= 2))

Exit Statuses, Return Codes, String Test Conditionals, More Special Variables.

 
Goal:
The goal of this exercise is to create a shell script that adds users to the same Linux system as the script is executed on.
Scenario:
Imagine that you're working as a Linux System Administrator for a fast growing company.  The latest company initiative requires you to build and deploy dozens of servers.  You're falling behind schedule and are going to miss your deadline for these new server deployments because you are constantly being interrupted by the help desk calling you to create new Linux accounts for all the people in the company who have been recruited to test out the company's newest Linux-based application.
In order to meet your deadline and keep your sanity, you decide to write a shell script that will create new user accounts.  Once you're done with the shell script you can put the help desk in charge of creating new accounts which will finally allow you to work uninterrupted and complete your server deployments on time.

O/p:
 

Random Data, Cryptographic Hash Functions, Text and String Manipulation.
lRandom Data:
Echo ${RANDOM}
Positional Parameters, Arguments, for Loops, Special Parameters
It's a key part of conditional scripting:
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Command succeeded"
else
  echo "Command failed"
fi

Arguments in Shell:
Static input:
 
o/p
 

Positional Parameters

${0} fisrt argument
${1} second argument
${2} third argument
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ${#} -TOTAL NO.OF ARGUMENT

Dynamic Input:

 
O/P:
 

For loop:
 
o/p:
 
The while Loop, Infinite Loops, Shifting, Sleeping
While loop:
 
 
True: 
Do nothing return the exit comment as 0
Sleep:
 

SHIFT:
 
o/p:


 
For Loop:
for var in item1 item2 item3
do
  command(s)
done
Example:
for fruit in apple banana cherry
do
  echo "I like $fruit"
done
Output:
I like apple
I like banana
I like cherry

üîÅ 2. While Loop

while [ condition ]
do
  command(s)
done
Example:
count=1
while [ $count -le 3 ]
do
  echo "Count is $count"
  count=$((count + 1))
done
o/p:
Count is 1
Count is 2
Count is 3

Arrays: store multiple values in a single variable
Basic Array Syntax:
Declaring an Array:  Fruits=(apple,banana,watermelon)
Accessing Elements: echo ‚Äú${Fruits[0]}‚Äù
All Elements: echo ‚Äú${Fruits[@]}‚Äù
Array Length: echo ‚Äú${#Fruits[@]}‚Äù
