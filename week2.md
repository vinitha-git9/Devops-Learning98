# Linux Kernel and System Basics

## WEEK-1

## Kernel

The "father of the kernel," specifically referring to the Linux kernel, is **Linus Torvalds**.

The kernel is essentially the core of an operating system.  
It is the fundamental layer between computer hardware and software.  
It interacts with hardware and is often considered the nucleus of a computerâ€™s operating system.  
It manages system resources such as the processor, memory, and device drivers.  
The kernel is stored in the computerâ€™s memory.

### Types of Kernel

- **Monolithic Kernels**:  
  Entire OS including schedulers, file system, and device drivers is part of the kernel.  
  Can lead to complexity and potential instability if a service fails.

- **Microkernels**:  
  Run minimal services in kernel space for OS functionality.  
  Improves reliability and security.

- **Hybrid Kernels**:  
  Combine the advantages of monolithic and microkernels.  
  Some services run in kernel space, others in user space.

## Linux Distributions

A Linux distribution (or *distro*) is a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel.

### Components of a Linux Distribution

- Linux Kernel
- GNU Tools & Libraries
- Package Management System
- Software Applications
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- System Libraries & Utilities
- Bootloader

### Types of Distributions

- **General-Purpose**: Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint  
- **Enterprise**: RHEL, CentOS, SUSE  
- **Security-Focused**: Kali Linux, Parrot OS  
- **Lightweight**: Lubuntu, Puppy Linux  
- **Specialized**: Ubuntu Studio, Edubuntu, OpenWrt

### âœ… Why Use a Linux Distribution?

- Open Source and Free
- Secure
- Customizable
- Ideal for Development
- Resource-Efficient
- Wide Variety
- Stable & Reliable
- Community Support

## Linux File System
root directory / - top of the file system
| Directory | Purpose                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `/`       | Root of the file system                        |
| `/bin`    | Essential user binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cp`)     |
| `/sbin`   | System binaries (e.g., `init`, `reboot`)       |
| `/etc`    | System configuration files                     |
| `/home`   | User home directories                          |
| `/var`    | Variable data like logs (`/var/log`)           |
| `/usr`    | Secondary hierarchy: user apps and utilities   |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary files                                |
| `/dev`    | Device files (e.g., `/dev/sda`)                |
| `/proc`   | Virtual filesystem for process and kernel info |
| `/boot`   | Boot loader files (e.g., kernel images)        |

User management in Linux involves creating, modifying, and managing user accounts and groups to control access and permissions on the system.

| Task            | Command                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Add user        | `sudo adduser username` |
| Delete user     | `sudo deluser username` |
| Change password | `passwd username`       |
| Modify user     | `usermod`               |
| List users      | `cat /etc/passwd`       |


### ðŸ§© Key Linux User Management Commands

#### Creating Users

sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash username
sudo adduser username

#### Modifying Users

sudo usermod -aG groupname username

#### Deleting Users:
sudo userdel username

#### Managing Passwords

sudo passwd username
sudo passwd -l username   # Lock
sudo passwd -u username   # Unlock

#### Managing Groups

sudo groupadd groupname
sudo groupdel groupname
sudo gpasswd -a username groupname

4. Permission Levels
chmod 755 file.txt   # rwxr-xr-x
chown user:group file.txt
username â€“ login name

x â€“ password (stored in /etc/shadow)

UID â€“ User ID

GID â€“ Group ID

comment â€“ optional (full name or description)

home_directory â€“ default login directory

shell â€“ default command shell

/etc/shadow-
encrypted passwords 
/etc/group
group information
john:x:1001:1001:John Doe:/home/john:/bin/bash

## File Permissions

### Symbolic Representation

`-rwxr-xr--`

- First character: File type (`-` for file, `d` for directory)
- Next 3: Owner (read, write, execute)
- Next 3: Group
- Next 3: Others

### Numeric Representation

- `r = 4`, `w = 2`, `x = 1`
- Example: `755` = Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: r-x

### Changing Permissions

```bash
chmod u+x file
chmod 755 file
chown user:group file
umask 022
```

---

## Processes and Job Management

### Viewing Processes

```bash
ps aux
ps -ef
ps -u username
top
htop
```

### Process States

- **Running**
- **Sleeping**
- **Stopped**
- **Zombie**

### Signals

- `SIGINT (2)`: Ctrl+C
- `SIGTERM (15)`: Termination
- `SIGKILL (9)`: Force kill
- `SIGSTOP`: Pause
- `SIGCONT`: Resume

### Job Control

```bash
bg       # background
fg       # foreground
jobs     # list
kill PID
Ctrl+Z   # suspend
Ctrl+C   # terminate
```

## Package Management

### Software Distribution

- Packages include binaries, config, and metadata.

### Package Repositories

- Remote servers with software packages.

### Dependencies

- Required libraries that are automatically resolved during installation.

## File and Directory Management

```bash
ls       # List
pwd      # Print working directory
cd       # Change directory
mkdir    # Make directory
rmdir    # Remove directory
rm       # Remove file/directory
cp       # Copy
mv       # Move/Rename
```

---

## File Viewing and Editing

```bash
cat filename
less filename
nano filename
vim filename
```

## System Information

```bash
top
df
free
uname -a
```

---

## Networking

```bash

## Init System

- The **init system** is the first process (PID 1).
- It initializes system services, manages targets/runlevels, and handles shutdown.

## Log Files in `/var/log`

- System Logs
- Authentication Logs
- Cron Logs
- Mail Logs
- Application Logs
- Background Services Logs
