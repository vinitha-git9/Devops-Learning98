ðŸ”¶ 1. Public IP, Private IP, IPv4 & IPv6
ðŸ“Œ Public IP
Assigned by AWS (automatically or manually).

Used when you want your EC2 instance to communicate with the internet.

Associated with Elastic IP if you want a persistent public IP.

ðŸ“Œ Private IP
Used for internal communication between instances within the same VPC.

Not routable from the internet.

Each instance gets a private IP from the subnetâ€™s CIDR block.

ðŸ“Œ IPv4
Format: 192.168.1.1 (32-bit).

AWS allows CIDR block allocation like 10.0.0.0/16.

ðŸ“Œ IPv6
Format: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 (128-bit).

Not enabled by default in VPC.

Supports massive scale and internet-ready communication.

ðŸ”¶ 2. VPC, CIDR, Subnets
ðŸ“Œ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Your own isolated network in AWS cloud.

You can control IP ranges, subnets, route tables, gateways, etc.

Can span across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

ðŸ“Œ CIDR Block
Defines IP range of the VPC.

Example: 10.0.0.0/16 â†’ gives 65,536 IP addresses.

Each subnet is a subset of the VPCâ€™s CIDR block.

ðŸ“Œ Subnets
Segments of the VPC.

You typically create:

Public Subnets â†’ connect to the internet.

Private Subnets â†’ no direct internet access.

Each subnet must be in one Availability Zone only.

ðŸ”¶ 3. NACL, Security Groups
ðŸ“Œ Network Access Control List (NACL)
Stateless firewall: Rules must be defined for both inbound and outbound traffic.

Applied at subnet level.

Useful for controlling traffic at a broader level (e.g., allow only certain IP ranges).

Example Rule: Allow port 80 inbound from 0.0.0.0/0.

ðŸ“Œ Security Groups
Stateful firewall: If inbound is allowed, outbound is automatically allowed.

Applied to EC2 instances (not subnets).

Acts like a virtual firewall for your instance.

Example: Allow SSH (port 22) from your IP only.

ðŸ”¶ 4. NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, Route Tables
ðŸ“Œ Internet Gateway (IGW)
A component that allows instances in your VPC to access the internet.

Must be attached to the VPC.

Route table must have a route like:

0.0.0.0/0 â†’ IGW (for public subnet)

ðŸ“Œ NAT Gateway
Allows instances in private subnets to access the internet (e.g., for software updates).

Blocks inbound traffic initiated from the internet.

Needs a public subnet and Elastic IP.

ðŸ“Œ Route Tables
Defines how traffic is routed in your VPC.

Each subnet is associated with one route table.

Example entries:

Local â†’ for internal VPC traffic.

0.0.0.0/0 â†’ IGW (for public subnets)

0.0.0.0/0 â†’ NAT Gateway (for private subnets)
